# Insurance Distributed Applications
Note: This is a work in progress, feel free to help it move along faster.

Here's how it could possibly work:
You sign up for this health/flight/car/etc insurance by sending monthly payments to a "smart contract". The money is kept in a special account and distributed by an automated program.

When you go to the hospital, they might not know about this insurance or how to bill it so you may have to do it yourself. The way this is done is by submitting a "claim" to the automated program. This claim is then verified by paid workers using the Pangea Arbitration Token mechanism(they call the hospital, verify it, then click "pay claim"). Once it has been verified, the full amount is transferred to your wallet and you can then pay the bill.

How much does it cost? I don't know but the ideal situation would be to have $1million in the special account at all times, so the price you pay would be proportional to the amount of insurance money you use. If you have some chronic condition, you can expect it to cost as much as your ongoing care costs. If you are young and healthy, you can expect it to cost very little and increase slightly over time with no major increases, even if you have some major hospitalization, because you have been paying in for a long time and it smoothes the curve out. 

How is this different from centralized insurance? First of all, we don't have to pay a CEO $12million/year... so there's a huge cost reduction right there. Second, we don't have to pay profits to shareholers of a company. Third, it incentivizes people to lower the overall cost of health care by lowering their own costs, and in large numbers, we can all benefit. For example: I tell my doctor I want generic brand antibiotics($10) instead of brand-name($100) so that my insurance costs stay low. Over time, this doctor knows that his/her patients that have bitnation insurance want to save money and so he/she decides to use lower cost items. Also, as our numbers get larger, we would have collective power to influence hospitals and doctors; perhaps they will work with us to electronically submit claims so we don't need to pay people to verify them... maybe we can figure out ways to get drugs cheaper, etc.
