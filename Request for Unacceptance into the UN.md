Dear Ban Ki-Moon,

This letter is a formal request for Bitnation, a Decentralized Borderless Virtual Nation (DBVN), to be unaccepted into the United Nations. We already know you're not going to accept us as a nation so we're accepting your unacceptance. It's the polite thing to do. 

Our world is run by insane oligarchs fixated on individual material gain and absolute power. They have created conditions that have the potential to make humanity extinct through nuclear war, climate change, and weaponized artificial intelligence. Our democracies have been made into a joke through election rigging, gerrymandering, fake news, propaganda, corporate media, lobbying(aka bribery), surveillance, and more. It has become so intolerable that we, the people of Bitnation, cast off all legacy nation-states and declare our independence. A formal indictment of the United States of America and formal declaration of independence is laid forth here:
https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/Declaration%20of%20independence.md

We repectfully request that all legacy nation-states recognize their obsoleteness and acknowledge that they are unfit to rule over humanity. They have left us with no choice but to govern ourselves; and so we shall. By a mandate of the people, we have created a new social contract, the constitution of Bitnation, here:
https://github.com/Bit-Nation/BITNATION-Constitution/blob/master/README.md

This new constitution revokes all legacy nation-state sovereignty. We will cross your imaginary borders, with or without your consent. We will not obey your laws we didn't consent to. We will not fund your marble castles with gold toilet seats.
